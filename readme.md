## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose 
- Redis (for caching)

### Steps

#### **Local Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chetana1911/BharatFD_FAQs_Management_System.git
   cd faq_project



2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source  `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the Redis server. If you're using Docker, you can run Redis using:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. Apply migrations to set up the database:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Create a superuser for Django Admin:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

Now you can access the project at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üì° API Usage

The system exposes a **REST API** to manage and retrieve FAQs.

### Endpoints

1. **GET /api/faqs/**: Get a list of FAQs.
    - Example: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/`
    - Supports language selection with the `?lang=<language_code>` query parameter.

    **Example Requests:**
    ```bash
    # Fetch FAQs in English (default)
    curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/

    # Fetch FAQs in Hindi
    curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/?lang=hi

    # Fetch FAQs in Bengali
    curl http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/?lang=bn
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Caching

The API uses **Redis** for caching FAQ translations. By default, the cache is stored in `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Admin Panel

You can access the Django admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.
- Login with the superuser credentials you created earlier.
- Manage FAQs and their translations.

## Docker Support

This project comes with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file for containerized deployment.

### Running with Docker

1. Build and run the containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üß™ Tests

To run tests, make sure to activate your virtual environment and run:

```bash
pytest
```
